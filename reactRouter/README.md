This project demonstrates the implementation of React Router DOM to handle client-side routing in a React application. It includes navigation between multiple pages without reloading, showcasing concepts like dynamic routes, nested routes, and route parameters.


Features:

1). React Router DOM for seamless navigation
2). Dynamic & Nested Routing for structured page transitions

3). Protected Routes (if implemented) for authentication-based access.

4). Minimal & Clean UI


# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
